I bet you're curious about what's going to go here aren't you! Well, be curious no more! It'll be documentation. How dull. 

Hopefully, you won't need to refer to it much. In fact, to start with, I'm not writing anything here at all! It goes like this: 

1. See if I can make it self documenting
2. Try reaaaly hard to make it self documenting
3. Include documentation somewhere super close to whatever you were trying to do (such as in the "Help" output of a command, with a helpful note when you malform a command)
4. Write documentation here. 

You'll know if I fail about any of the above if I write things here.
