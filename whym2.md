# Why Magento 2 

I work with it professionally. Plus, I happen to think it's pretty well designed. It's super extensible, runs quite well up to millions of dollers / year turnover (and it's not really struggling) and it's supported by a lovely team of developers.

I haven't really compared it to other shopping platforms.
